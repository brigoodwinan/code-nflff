Do we allow for in-season trades, etc.?

Need to know the schedule to understand bye weeks and match difficulties.

Handle situations where BYE weeks don't overlap with players.

Need to be able to create a list of all players with priority regardless of position because that is how the draft works:
e.g.:
1. Aa - WR
2. Bb - RB
3. Cc - QB
4. Dd - QB
5. Ee - WR
6. etc.

Use team Elo and a penalty for an away game. - model fit on previous seasons, which use ELOs, and away v home. - logistic regression: [Team elo], [opp elo], [a/h], output: [W/L]
